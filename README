http://rsence.org/


== DESCRIPTION:

Simple C extension that produces variable-length random ascii-safe strings quickly.
This used to be a fixed part of the Riassence Framework, but it's distributed as a separate gem now.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'randgen'
  
  # Makes a RandGen instance that generates random strings 64 bytes long
  randgen = RandGen.new( 64 )
  
  # Generate a single rangom string
  random_string = ranggen.gen
  
  # Generate 100 random strings in an Array
  arr_of_100_rand_strings = randgen.gen_many( 100 )

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Rake and such build tools usually needed for Ruby C extensions. Depends otherwise just on stdlib's <time.h>

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install rsence-randgen
